# Music Lyric Twitter Bot 

### About 

The Music Lyric Twitter Bot is a bot that posts snippets of lyrics from a random popular artist's song on Twitter. It gives the name of the song and the lyric snippet in every tweet. It is formated in a question to entice people to reply to the Bot the song that the lyric is from.  

This bot was created with Node.js and Javascript. As well as uses the Api's from Musixmatch and Twitter.  

### How to Use 
This bot is currently posting on an interval of one hour. 

**Note:** To use this bot you will need to get api keys from Musixmatch and Twitter. As well as create a config.js file containing objects with the related API information for the two API's as seen in app.js. 

**Node Packages used:** Twit, Musicmatch

### Future plans 

In the future I want to expand the Twitter Bot to reply to the tweet with the correct answer to the song as well as replying to whoever tweets back at the bot whether their answer was correct or not. This will turn my bot into more pd a game than it is strucutred currently.
